# Unit Converter App

This is a simple web application that allows you to convert between metric and imperial units. It supports the following unit conversions:

- 1 meter = 3.281 feet
- 1 liter = 0.264 gallon
- 1 kilogram = 2.204 pound

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Enter a numerical value in the input field provided.
2. Click the "Convert" button to perform the unit conversions.
3. The converted values will be displayed in the respective sections below.

The app provides conversions for length, volume, and mass units. The converted values are updated dynamically when you click the "Convert" button.

## How It Works

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the app, including the input field, conversion sections, and the necessary elements for displaying the converted values.
2. The CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles for the app, including the layout, colors, and typography. The styles have been updated to make the app responsive and prevent text overflow.
3. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the logic of the app. It retrieves the necessary elements from the HTML file using their respective IDs and sets up an event listener on the "Convert" button.
4. When the "Convert" button is clicked, the JavaScript code retrieves the input value, performs the necessary calculations based on the conversion ratios, and updates the content of the conversion sections with the converted values.
